  <summary>Traditional Billing</summary>
  
 The conventional method for collecting meter readings involves a dedicated person visiting each household to take a picture of the electric meter in order to gather data and calculate the electricity bill. However, this process can result in false readings or bills being calculated based on average usage if the house is closed or the picture is unreadable due to human error.

Currently, electricity is only provided through a post-paid system, which can cause problems such as delays in bill payment and latency of actions, such as cutting off electricity when payment is due. These issues can be easily solved by introducing a [pre-paid system](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/article/prepaid-smart-electric-meters-needless-expense-or-sure-shot-way-to-cut-power-theft/803905).

During the pandemic, the Indian government declared that no readings would be taken during the lockdown period, and electricity bills would be issued based on average usage over the last three months. However, this resulted in improper bill calculations, inconvenience for consumers, and financial losses for the government.

  <summary>DISCOM Epidemic:</summary>
  
  The link between payment and supply is severed, and those who evade payment receive the same quality of supply as those who pay in full. This reinforces the view that electricity is a right. These steps can be seen as parts of a low-quality, low-payment equilibrium that can differentiate electricity markets in developed and developing countries.

The perception of electricity as a right can have serious ramifications for the development of reliable electricity systems. It can undermine the efforts of governments to provide universal access to electricity, reduce the quality of supply, and lead to financial losses for distribution companies.

To address these issues, it is essential to find a balance between the perception of electricity as a right and the need to provide reliable and affordable electricity to all. This requires a comprehensive approach that includes measures such as the promotion of energy conservation, the use of smart meters to detect and prevent electricity theft, and the development of sustainable infrastructure.

Overall, while the idea of electricity as a right is important, it is essential to recognize that it can have unintended consequences. By understanding the potential pitfalls of this perception, we can work towards creating a reliable and sustainable electricity system that benefits everyone
