# Automated Electricity Metering System
## Problems:
### Traditional Billing
  
 The conventional method for collecting meter readings involves a dedicated person visiting each household to take a picture of the electric meter in order to gather data and calculate the electricity bill. However, this process can result in false readings or bills being calculated based on average usage if the house is closed or the picture is unreadable due to human error.

Currently, electricity is only provided through a post-paid system, which can cause problems such as delays in bill payment and latency of actions, such as cutting off electricity when payment is due. These issues can be easily solved by introducing a [pre-paid system](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/article/prepaid-smart-electric-meters-needless-expense-or-sure-shot-way-to-cut-power-theft/803905).

During the pandemic, the Indian government declared that no readings would be taken during the lockdown period, and electricity bills would be issued based on average usage over the last three months. However, this resulted in improper bill calculations, inconvenience for consumers, and financial losses for the government.

### DISCOM Epidemic
  
  The link between payment and supply is severed, and those who evade payment receive the same quality of supply as those who pay in full. This reinforces the view that electricity is a right. These steps can be seen as parts of a low-quality, low-payment equilibrium that can differentiate electricity markets in developed and developing countries.

The perception of electricity as a right can have serious ramifications for the development of reliable electricity systems. It can undermine the efforts of governments to provide universal access to electricity, reduce the quality of supply, and lead to financial losses for distribution companies.

To address these issues, it is essential to find a balance between the perception of electricity as a right and the need to provide reliable and affordable electricity to all. This requires a comprehensive approach that includes measures such as the promotion of energy conservation, the use of smart meters to detect and prevent electricity theft, and the development of sustainable infrastructure.

Overall, while the idea of electricity as a right is important, it is essential to recognize that it can have unintended consequences. By understanding the potential pitfalls of this perception, we can work towards creating a reliable and sustainable electricity system that benefits everyone

## Solutions:

### Prepaid Meter

  The user can manage their electricity consumption by recharging the electric meter with the desired amount and using it accordingly. Once the recharge is complete, the user can repeat the process.
  This device will come with a sensor and a mechanism to capture readings, as well as a SIM card that will connect the device to the internet. The SIM card can be provided by a government-owned telecommunications service provider (such as BSNL), which will enable the government to offer this service to consumers free of charge. If this is not possible, the government can add a minimal amount of charges to the electricity bill itself. This process will provide business to the already established telecommunication organization and help recover all the financial losses resulting from human errors and inevitable circumstances.
In addition to these features, the user will also have access to graphical tools that are easy to understand and will help them analyze their consumption habits. This will allow users to be more responsible with their electricity usage.


### Postpaid Meter

  Introducing automation to the process of data gathering can easily handle the human errors and inevitable circumstances that often arise. A simple external device can be installed next to the meters in every household, which can then be connected to the internet and transmit data directly to the service provider's server. This will allow for the calculation of bills without the need for any human interaction.
  
  
### Usage Prediction
Using machine learning prediction to forecast electricity usage can be a great help to distribution companies as it allows them to plan and prepare for future demand. By utilizing the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, data can be analyzed and patterns can be identified to make more accurate predictions, leading to better decision-making. Moreover, this technique can also be used to optimize energy consumption by identifying the most efficient use of energy resources, which can result in cost savings and a safer and more sustainable energy infrastructure.
