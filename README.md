# Automated Electricity Metering System
## Necessity of the proposal

The conventional method for collecting meter readings involves a dedicated person visiting each household to take a picture of the electric meter in order to gather data and calculate the electricity bill. However, this process can result in false readings or bills being calculated based on average usage if the house is closed or the picture is unreadable due to human error.

Currently, electricity is only provided through a post-paid system, which can cause problems such as delays in bill payment and latency of actions, such as cutting off electricity when payment is due. These issues can be easily solved by introducing a pre-paid system.

During the pandemic, the Indian government declared that no readings would be taken during the lockdown period, and electricity bills would be issued based on average usage over the last three months. However, this resulted in improper bill calculations, inconvenience for consumers, and financial losses for the government.
